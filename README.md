## About this project:
Data Wrangling is a core process in the field of Data Analysis. Wrangling is a fun and iterative process. So lets get on a journey on Wrangling a dataset and analysing it for further usage

## Dataset Used:
 The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the
tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates , also known as WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.
The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10,
etc. Why? Because "
they're good dogs Brent
." WeRateDogs has over 4
million followers and has received international media coverage.
